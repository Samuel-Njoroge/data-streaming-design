# Designing a Streaming Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform.
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a streaming data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) technologies. The pipeline processes real-time data, performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, and stores the processed data in a scalable and accessible format.

## Use Case Scenario
In a modern data-driven environment, real-time data processing is crucial for applications that require up-to-the-minute insights. 
This project is ideal for scenarios such as:
1. *Real-time analytics* - Analyzing live data streams from various sources to gain immediate insights.
2. *Event-driven systems* - Processing events as they occur to trigger automated responses.
3. *Data aggregation* - Combining data from multiple real-time sources for comprehensive analysis.

## Objectives
- Build a robust streaming data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform tools.
- Process data in real-time from ingestion to storage, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- Utilize managed services to handle ETL operations efficiently without the need for extensive infrastructure management.
- Store and analyze processed data using BigQuery for scalable and performant analytics

## Technology Stack
- `Python` - Used for writing data processing scripts and custom logic.
- `Cloud Storage` - Object storage solution for storing raw and processed data.
- `Dataflow` - Managed service for executing ETL operations, leveraging Apache Beam.
- `Apache Beam` - Provides a unified programming model for both batch and stream data processing.
- `BigQuery` - Scalable data warehouse and analytics platform for querying and analyzing large datasets.
- `GCloud SDK` - Command-line tool for interacting with GCP resources and managing the pipeline.
- `Pub/Sub` - Messaging service for real-time data ingestion and event-driven processing.
